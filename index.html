                    <li>Was the Software Developer for the Mission Analysis Software (MAS) suite of flight dynamics
                        tools. The MAS suite provides analysis of orbital dynamics problems pertaining to satellite
                        orbit
                        propagation and determination, station-keeping and apogee insertion maneuvers, close approach
                        screening and collision avoidance, and spacecraft end-of-life studies. The MAS suite is used for
                        the
                        purpose of mission design, transfer orbit control, and geosynchronous orbit control of
                        three-axis
                        stabilized spacecraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>Assigned duties include the full lifecycle of software maintenance, development and user support
                        during critical phases of the satellite transfer orbit. Used ClearCase as the Software
                        Configuration Management (SCM) system for release and build version control and the
                        SunStudio/Solaris development tool suite, the C programming language and MOTIF user
                        interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inherited the MAS software when a senior staff developer retired after ~20 years of working on
                        the project. Quickly picked up and developed an understanding of the ~400K lines of legacy
                        C/MOTIF code. Facilitated three major software releases for large scale, geo and low earth orbit
                        satellites. All of the software releases followed the Lockheed Martin Common Integrated Process
                        System (CIPS) and maintained a CMMI level 3 maturity level. Lockheed Martin‚Äôs CIPS is a
                        characterized and proactive approach to software development.
                    </li>
                    <li>Petitioned the proposal group and developed a formal statement of work to use the MAS suite for
                        new commercial bids. As a result of my proposal work, the MAS suite is currently being reviewed
                        by a large premium satellite operator with a global customer base to be used as their primary
                        orbital mechanics software.

                    <li>Provided software development support for the Satellite Telemetry Analysis and Real-Time
                        System (STARS). The STARS ground software provides complete Satellite operations capability for
                        real-time monitoring and telemetry processing for transfer and on station satellite operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>The STARS development team utilized Visual C++ using the Microsoft Visual Studio programming
                        environment.

                    <li>Joined the project in the early stage of the software‚Äôs maturity level and quickly picked up
                        the ~80k lines of code and immediately made an impact on the development cycle. Spent time
                        debugging software problem reports, and developing enhancements. As added support, completed
                        scripting projects in Visual Basic, Perl as well as the Unix shell. Also supported automated
                        satellite operations procedure development using the ISI ground system.
                    </li>
                    <li>While working on the STARS project, helped bring the system from an early beta product to a
                        piece of software now used on 5 transfer orbit missions and long term operations for two
                        commercial satellite customers.

                        relocation. During this time also supported long term operations for 5 other geosynchronous
                        A2100x and S7000 satellites, performing station keeping maneuvers, commanding, ranging and
                        telemetry monitoring. Regularly filled gaps in labor supporting larger missions as shift
                        supervisor, mission controller and mission operator during Bus and Payload in-orbit test and
                        station relocation before customer handover on a 24/7 rotating schedule.
